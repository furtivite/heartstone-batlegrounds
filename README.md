# My Achievements of Blizzard's Heartstone Battleground

It should work like this: You click on the button, and see the list of heroes of Hearthstone Battlegrounds, which you did not take the first place. Now you can choose exactly these heroes and get the missing achievements.

You can add your own button and use the feature for your account. To do this, add the desired value to the `games` section of the `heroesList` array. The standard value for a character that you did not take first place in the battlefields is `false`. You also need to create a function similar to `gamingEgor`, where you specify your nickname.
